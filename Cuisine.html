  <h2>Fruits</h2>
  
  <br><br><h3>Âlbâloo (sour cherries)</h3>
  <p>Prunus cerasus (sour cherry, art cherry, or dwarf cherry) is a species of Prunus in the subgenus Cerasus (cherries), native to much of Europe and southwest Asia. It is closely related to the sweet cherry, but has a fruit that is more acidic. The tree is smaller than the sweet cherry, has twiggy branches, and its crimson-to-near-black cherries are borne upon shorter stalks. There are several varieties of the sour cherry: the dark-red morello cherry and the lighter-red varieties including the amarelle cherry. and the popular Montmorency cherry. The Montmorency cherry is the most popular type of sour cherry in America. The reason for its popularity is its use in baking and recipe creation. including cherry pies, cherry desserts and other cherry-based recipes. In Iran they are mostly served with some salt on them, so it won’t be as sour as it was.</p>

  <br><br><h3>Châghâle bâdum (Fresh Green Almonds)</h3>
  <p>Green almonds are distinguishable by their fuzzy, green outer hull. Within the green hull, the flesh offers a soft jelly consistency within a skinless nut. If the Green almond is left on the tree to grow and dry out it will eventually harden, split, and reveal a conventional almond. The Green almond can be eaten whole when fresh, green skin and all. When the Green almond is slightly older, the green hull will become tough and bitter and should be removed and the inner almond eaten on its own. The Green almond offers a complex flavor with mild floral and grass-like notes and an overall sweet-tart flavor that is compared to that of green apple, pea pods, and uncured olives. Both peaches and almonds are thought to have evolved from the same ancient rootstock and as the terrain of the continents changed and mountains between China and Central Asia developed, peaches spread into eastern China, and almonds westward. As nomads discovered the fruits of the almond tree and took them with them as they traveled the almond spread rapidly. Evidence of this can be found in the existence of wild trees along trade routes and population centers near many ancient cities. Almond trees first cultivated in the Mediterranean climate regions of Iran, Spain, Greece, Israel, and Rome. In the 1700’s the almond tree first made its way from Spain to the United States via Franciscan Padres. Almond trees did not have success right away and it was not until 1850 that pioneers in California would pinpoint the ideal growing conditions that would put the almond on its path to becoming the most popularly produced nut in the United States. These fruits much like the sour cherries are dipped in salt and served</p>

 <br><br><h3>Goje sabz (Green Gages)</h3>
  <p>Greengage fruit originated in Iran. "Green Gages" were allegedly first imported into England from France in 1724 by Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet, from whom they get their English name, though a greengage seed was found embedded in a 15th-c building in Hereford. Allegedly, the labels identifying the French plum trees were lost in transit to Gage's home at Hengrave Hall, near Bury St. Edmunds. Soon after, greengages were cultivated in the American colonies, even being grown on the plantations of American presidents George Washington (1732–1799) and Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826). However, their cultivation in North America has declined significantly since the 18th century. The name Reine Claude, by which they are known in France, is in honour of the French queen Claude (1499–1524), Duchess of Brittany. Greengages are also called la bonne reine (French for "the good Queen") in France. Greengage fruit are identified by their round-oval shape and smooth-textured, pale green flesh; they are on average smaller than round plums but larger than mirabelle plums. The skin ranges in colour from green to yellowish, with a pale blue "blush" in some cultivars; a few Reine Claudes – such as 'Graf Althanns' – are reddish-purple due to crossbreeding with other plums. Greengages are grown in temperate areas and are known for the rich, confectionery flavour. They are considered to be among the finest dessert plums. Also like the other two fruits they are served with salt.</p>

 <br><br><h3>Khormâloo (persimmon)</h3>
  <p>The persimmon is the edible fruit of a number of species of trees in the genus Diospyros. The most widely cultivated of these is the Asian or Japanese persimmon, Diospyros kaki. Diospyros is in the family Ebenaceae, and a number of non-persimmon species of the genus are grown for ebony timber. The tree Diospyros kaki is the most widely cultivated species of persimmon. Typically the tree reaches 4.5 to 18 metres (15 to 60 ft) in height and is round-topped. It usually stands erect, but sometimes can be crooked or have a willowy appearance. The leaves alternate, are oblong with brown-hairy petioles that are 2 centimetres (0.8 in) in length. They are leathery and glossy on the upper surface, brown and silky underneath. The leaves are deciduous and bluish-green in color. In the fall, they turn to yellow, orange, or red. Persimmon trees are typically dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are produced on separate trees. Some trees have both male and female flowers and in rare cases also bear the 'perfect' flower. Male flowers are pink and appear in groups of 3. They have a 4-parted calyx, a corolla, and 24 stamens in 2 rows. Female flowers are creamy-whiteand appear singly. They have a large calyx, a 4-parted, yellow corolla, 8 undeveloped stamens, and a rounded ovary bearing the style and stigma. 'Perfect' flowers are a cross between the two and contain both male and female reproductive organs.</p>

  <h2>Nuts</h2>
  
  <br><br><h3>Ajil</h3>
  <p>Ajil is a general term Iranians use for any type of mixed nuts. Every Iranian home has an assortment of nuts available at any hour. Ajil may be sweet or salted. Salted Ajil comprises almonds, tokhmeh hindwaneh roasted melon seeds, tokhmeh kadoo roasted squash seeds, roasted chickpeas, hazelnuts, cashews and walnuts. Sweet Ajil will comprise nuts and raisins, dried figs, sweets and sugar cubes.Ajil is associated with different occasions and celebrations and is a part of the spread of a Sofreh, Sofreh Aghd and Sofreh Nooruz. Sometimes people carry some Ajil from a Sofreh for good luck. On a visit to a Persian home, Ajil is most definitely something that guests will be served.</p>

 <br><br><h3>Pistachio (Pesteh)</h3>
  <p>Pistachios are a hot favorite with any Iranian. In fact, Iranian pistachio trees have been around for thousands of years and are mainly found in Kerman province, where more than 160,000 hectares of land is used to grow pistachios. Iranian pistachios can be salted, roasted, flavored with lime, spice or eaten plain. Iran tops the world in the production of pistachios and produces the finest varieties of pistachios. The various varieties include Fandoghi (round pistachios), Kallehghouchi jumbo pistachios, Akbari (long pistachios) or Ahmadaghi Badami. Iran is the largest producer of pistachios in the world. Iranian pistachios are very delicious and are available in many varieties and flavors. No other producer can compete with Iranian pistachios.</p>

 <br><br><h3>Saffron</h3>
  <p>Saffron and Iran are uniquely linked together. Iran harvests about 80% of the world’s production of saffron. Despite its small size, this spice is quite expensive, and is suitable for many applications.Saffron is a spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus, commonly known as the "saffron crocus". The vivid crimson stigmas and styles, called threads, are collected and dried to be used mainly as a seasoning and colouring agent in food. Saffron was long among the world's most costly spices by weight.</p>

 <br><br><h3>Dried Fig (Anjir)</h3>
  <p>According to laboratory analysis, there are about 20% more calories in an Iranian dried fig than in that of figs from the U.S.A. or Turkey. The FAO recognizes the Iranian city, Fars, as being the best region in the world for the cultivation of figs. Figs originated in Arabia and grow best in areas with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Although considered a fruit, the fig is actually an inverted flower, and the seeds are the fruit, according to the California Fig Advisory Board. Flower or fruit, the nutrient-rich dried fig can help you meet some of your essential nutrient needs, making it a healthy addition to your diet.</p>

 <br><br><h3>Barberry (Zereshk)</h3>
  <p>Berberis vulgaris, also known as common barberry, European barberry or simply barberry, is a shrub in the genus Berberis. It produces edible but sharply acidic berries, which people in many countries eat as a tart and refreshing fruit. Verzaj or Zereshk is the Persian name given to dried fruit of barberry. Berberis Vulgaris is the scientific name for this plant which commonly known as barberry.</p>

 <br><br><h3>Persian Dried Fruits</h3>
  <p>Dried fruit is a fruit which the majority of the original water content has been, removed either naturally, through sun drying, or through the use of specialized dryers (heated wind tunnel dryers) or dehydrators. Dried fruits retain most of the nutritional value of fresh fruits. The specific nutrient content of the different dried fruits reflects their fresh counterpart and the processing method. Persian dried fruits are also important sources of vitamins, minerals and fiber and provide a wide array of bio-active components. Some are infused with a sweetener (i.e. sucrose syrup) prior to drying. Some are candied fruit. And some are simply sold as dried fruit.</p>

  <h2>Persian Dishes</h2>
  
  <br><br><h3>Fesenjan (Pomegranate Walnut Stew)</h3>
  <p>This iconic stew, an essential part of every Persian wedding menu, pairs tart pomegranate with chicken or duck. Ground walnuts, pomegranate paste and onions are slowly simmered to make a thick sauce. Sometimes saffron and cinnamon are added, and maybe a pinch of sugar to balance the acid. Fesenjan has a long pedigree. At the ruins of Persepolis, the ancient ritual capital of the Persian Empire, archaeologists found inscribed stone tablets from as far back as 515 B.C., which listed pantry staples of the early Iranians. They included walnuts, poultry and pomegranate preserves, the key ingredients in fesenjan.</p>

  <br><br><h3>Baghali Polo (Rice With Dill And Fava Beans)</h3>
  <p>In Iranian cooking, rice can be prepared simply with butter and saffron, known as chelo. But just as often, it’s cooked with other ingredients and called polo. Polo can be made with herbs, vegetables, beans, nuts, dried fruit, meat and even noodles, and acts as the centerpiece of the meal. This polo is particularly good in the spring, when fava beans are young and tender and dill is in season. The dish is flecked with green dill and favas, and is often cooked with very tender chunks of lamb. Alternately, it may be served alongside lamb on the bone. The rice should have a mild saffron flavor, with the saffron mixed into the rice just before serving.</p>

 <br><br><h3>Zereshk Polo (Barberry Rice)</h3>
  <p>Iranians love sour flavors. Like cranberries, barberries have a vibrant red color, but they’re even more sour. This classic rice dish is studded with the red berries, which are dried and then rehydrated before cooking. The rice is cooked with plenty of butter, which helps to soften the intensity of the berries. Quince, rhubarb, green plums, sour oranges, lemons, limes, dried limes, sour cherries, tamarind, sumac and pomegranate are all used in Persian cooking to make food more tart.</p>

 <br><br><h3>Gormeh Sabzi (Green Herb Stew)</h3>
  <p>Made from herbs, kidney beans and lamb, deep green gormeh sabzi satisfies two Persian flavor obsessions: it’s sour and full of herbs. The stew is seasoned with dried limes, limoo omani in Farsi. These limes are extra intense and sour, with a bittersweet taste that gives the stew a unique flavor. The other constant in gormeh sabzi is fenugreek leaves, a taste unfamiliar to most westerners. Other herbs include parsley, coriander and scallions.</p>

 <br><br><h3>Ash e Reshteh (Noodle and Bean Soup)</h3>
  <p>A richly textured soup full of noodles, beans, herbs and leafy greens like spinach and beet leaves. It’s topped with mint oil, crunchy fried onions and sour kashk, a fermented whey product eaten in the Middle East that tastes akin to sour yogurt. The noodles, which made their way to Iran from China, are thought to represent the many paths of life, and this soup is traditionally served when someone sets off on a long journey. Because of its auspicious ingredients, it’s also part of the menu for Norooz, the Persian new year, which occurs at the spring equinox in March.</p>

 <br><br><h3>Tahdig (Crunchy Fried Rice)</h3>
  <p>Tahdig is the soul food of Persian cooking. It’s the crisp, golden layer of fried rice at the bottom of the rice pot, and it tastes like a combination of popcorn and potato chips, but with the delicate flavor of basmati ice. (Tahdig is usually not printed on the menu, so you may have to ask for it.) At Iranian family gatherings, there are always plenty of leftovers, but the one dish that disappears completely is tahdig. It’s eaten as a side dish, and it’s forgivable to pick it up and eat it with your fingers.</p>

 <br><br><h3>Kebab (Lamb, Chicken, Lamb Liver, Ground Meat)</h3>
  <p>Kebabs have more variety than you might think. First, there’s koobideh, ground meat seasoned with minced onion, salt and pepper. It sounds simple, but the taste is sublime. There is kebab-e barg, thinly sliced lamb or beef, flavored with lemon juice and onion and basted with saffron and butter. Chicken kebab, known as joojeh, is traditionally made from a whole chicken, bones and all, for more flavor (although in American restaurants it’s often made from skinless chicken breast), marinated in lemon and onion, and basted with saffron and butter. If you’re lucky, you’ll find jigar, lamb liver kebab, garnished with fresh basil leaves and a wedge of lemon.</p>
